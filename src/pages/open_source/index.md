Open Source Software refers to applications / libraries / frameworks whose design and code is publicly available, which allows users to modify and share updated versions.

Opposite of "proprietary" software, which a company sells to you and does not allow you to modify or usually even inspect.

Generally trustworthy because of transparency, but don't click on random links / downloads / scripts.
