Term associated with writing the code that produces the (appealing) visual aspects of an application.

Generally encompasses websites, mobile sites / apps, and desktop apps. 

# Tools: Web

HTML, CSS, and [Javascript](/javascript) are the foundation of Frontend Dev.

HTML: Structure of a webpage

CSS: Styling of the page

[Javascript](/javascript): Functionality of the page

## Frontend JS Tools

Vue, [React](/react), Angular: Javascript libraries that make it significantly easier to manipulate elements of a webpage and seperate logic of different components / widgets into small files.

## Frontend Python Tools

Templating: Django and Flask use Template languages to render python variables / backend data dynamically (Flask's is called [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/2.11.x/))

This is converted to HTML in the 'render' process. Usually Javascript is used to make the page more functional than having clickable links.
